<img src="/assets/img/portrait2.jpg" alt="sustech-logo" width="200" align="left" hspace="25" vspace="0"/>My research is on machine learning for medical applications. I mainly focus on medical application that can be implemented as a tool in the clinic and help doctors and clinicians with decision support in diagnostics and patient triage. An important part of developing systems for medical applications is to validate the it correctly, doing prospective and randomized cotrol studies. Finaly, I also think such systems should be understood by humans, and therfore I also focus on explainable AI (XAI) in my research. This can be helpful both in terms of transparency and for debugging the system, but also this can be used to discover new medical information which can be applied and further studied by clinicians.


<img src="/assets/img/siv.jpg" alt="Vestfold Hospital Trust" width="200" align="right" hspace="25" vspace="0"/>I work partly (50%) as a health informatician and advisor at the innovation and research department at Vestfold Hospital Trust in Tønsberg. Here I help clinicians and researchers with their projects, ranging from starting a new health register to data wrangling and statistics. In addition to helping other researchers with their project I also work on my own research projects ([VO2max estimation in obese patients](/projects/1_project)), and supervise bachelor and master students.

<img src="/assets/img/ahus.jpg" alt="Akershus Universit Hospital" width="200" align="left" hspace="25" vspace="0"/>The other 50% of my work time I am doing a PhD at the department of e-health and technology at Akershus University Hospital in Lørenskog. The title of my project is: *Artificial intelligence-enabled ECG interpretation for improved detection of patients with myocardial infarction*. Here we use electrocardiograms (ECG) recorded in a clinical or prehospital setting and other clinical information to train a deep neural network to predict whether a patient has a acute myocardial infarction (total occluded coronary blood vessel) or not.
