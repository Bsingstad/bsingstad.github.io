Recently there is a growing interest in understanding the cancer ecosystem, which consists of not only tumour cells but also stromal cells, immune cells and in many cases, microbes. During my postdoc, I am using colorectal cancer as a model to study cancer ecosystem. However, the ecosystem of other cancer also demands detailed research. For instance, pancreatic cancer (PC) has a five-year survival rate of merely 9%; last year, it caused about 122,000 deaths in China. In PC, prognosis-related tumour microbiome and spatial heterogeneity have been observed but not been systematically studied as an ecosystem. Thus, I propose to systematically study the pancreatic cancer ecosystem with three aims.
